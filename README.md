# graphql-dsl

Goal: build your graphql schema with a nice dsl, be the poweruser and control everything that gets generated, does
nothing under the hood by default, no (or minimal) runtime reflection (excluding schema building)

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic types + fields
- [x] Scalars
- [x] Interfaces (not as type checked as I would)
- [ ] Field arguments
- [ ] Input objects
- [ ] Subscription type check
- [ ] Suspend fetchers
- [ ] Union types
- [ ] Automatic registration with reflection
- [ ] More type checking using reflection
